Question: why you the jps instead of swing?

 Answer: I used JavaServer Pages (JSP) for building web-based views instead of Swing. 
 Swing is a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit for Java desktop applications, 
 whereas JSP is a technology used in web development. 
 Swing is not typically used in conjunction with Spring Boot for web applications.
